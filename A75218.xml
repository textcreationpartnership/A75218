            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT was ſpoken long ſince by her coſen, a wiſe and learned Welſh Shentleman, that art had no enemy but ignorance; and therefore her ſhall not ſpeak much by way of Preface, Preludium or Exordium, for her do not doubt in the leaſt but to give her underſtanding Countreymen good content, and for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping zoiluſes and mumbling Mommuſes, her takes no care to pleaſe, but for her ingenuous ſons of art, her hopes her will take her pains and induſtry in good part, and ſo her begins her Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtication; and becauſe divers of her learned Aſtrologers, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially her own coſens and her Country men, differ about which moneth ſhould be the firſt in the yeer, ſom taking it to begin in <hi>Ianuary,</hi> others in <hi>March,</hi> therefore her will deliver her ſence concerning that point, and ſays that in her judgment the yeere begins in <hi>March,</hi> and that for theſe her welſh reaſons: Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe according to her rules of her welch art, the firſt day of <hi>March</hi> is St. <hi>Taffies</hi> day, at which time the Leeks be ripe and fit for her pot, and if her miſtake not, there will be a new Moon about the eighth day of <hi>March,</hi> five quarters of an hour paſt 5 at night; and therefore her doz conclude, by theſe her welſh reaſons, that the yeer begins in <hi>March.</hi> Another of her reaſons is, becauſe her own coſen and countreyman <hi>Lewis ap Shone,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a fery learned ſhentleman in the Mathematical Science, doz confirm her in her judgment; and now to her prognoſtication. In this Moneth her ſhall have fair weather if it be not foul, in this moneth alſo is a very good time for her to eat Leeks and Onions, eſpecially in her welſh porrage, it will moke her good plood, and will cleanſe her veins from excrementuous humours: in this Moneth her is fearful divers of her coſens and country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men will be in great danger, by reaſon of ſome malevolent Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets influence upon her deer countrymen; for if her be not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in her <hi>Annals,</hi> her Coſen <hi>Lewis Keeg Guidon</hi> was hang'd at <hi>Preſteign</hi> much about this time of the yeer, and if her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen be not ſerry careful of their own ſafeties, there will be many of her Countreymen go the ſame way: for her know, that when the ſign is in the neck, as it is on the 11 day of this moneth, her Countreymen are in much danger, of which her is

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:166851:4"/>of them, and ſent them over by ſhipping into <hi>Cornwall,</hi> which when her Majeſty of <hi>Cornwall</hi> perceived, her was worſe mad then before; whereupon her called her Councel together to conſult what was fit to be done in ſuch a caſe; whereupon, after much time ſpent in debate, ſome moving to hang them, others oppoſing that, alledged, that would make Hemp dear; and therefore in her judgment, it was beſt and the cheapeſt way to throw them all into the Sea, and drown them all: But againſt that was alledged, that that was the worſt way that could be to diſpoſe of them; for that was the way to breed a ſcarcity of fiſh in all the Nations round about, becauſe the French whores and Iriſh rogues were ſuch naſty ſtinking Cattel, that if her Maieſty ſhould throw them into the Sea, they would poyſon all the Fiſhes in the Sea, and ſo not only bring famine into her own Territories, but alſo provoke all the Princes round about her to war againſt her Crown and Kingdom; and if her ſhould hang them, it would not only make Hemp dear, but deſtroy all her loving Subiects with a peſtilential air, or ill ſmell; and if her drown them, it would poyſon all the fiſhes in the Sea, and bring famine upon all her Subiects, to her exceeding great detrement; wherefore there was a neceſſity to find out ſome other way, whereupon it was reſolved, that foraſmuch as <hi>Wales</hi> was not then inhabited, and that it was but a ſhort cut from <hi>Cornwall</hi> to <hi>Wales,</hi> and that as there was many hils, there could not chooſe but be ſome Dales, and they being there, they could neither make hemp dear, nor poiſon the fiſh, but if they poiſoned any body, they muſt poiſon one another; For theſe, and the like reaſons it was unanimouſly agreed <hi>Nemine contra diſſente,</hi> that they ſhould be forthwith ſent over, which was done according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and of their Off-ſpring came her welſh coſen and countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<q>
                     <l>Who ſince by Procreation,</l>
                     <l>Are now become a naſty Nation.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus her hopes her have done her Countrey good ſervice in freeing her Countrey-men from calumnies and aſperſions, alſo humbly craving pardon for her prolixity, it being fery needfull to clear her ſelf and her countreymen from ſuch aſperſions uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:166851:5"/>caſt upon her and her countreymen by prophane and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Engliſhmen; and as her have been long and large in ſome things, ſo her ſhall be prief and ſhort in ſom other, and ſo her comes to give her Iudgment to the gazing Star, or <hi>Stella nova,</hi> ſeen in and neer London, about the 22 and 23 of <hi>February,</hi> 1654.</p>
               <p>Her duz humbly conceive, that this Star duz portend (if any thing at all) either peace or war, or both, but which her do not fery wel know, becauſe her have not conſulted with her Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, becauſe her Library was burnt at the deſtruction of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Gomorah,</hi> which neither her ſelf, nor any body els for her is ever like to recover; but her have borrowed one of the Modern Aſtrologers books, which tells her, that Stars at that time of the day, ſignifie only fair and dry weather, her duz con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs if there be no rain, it is like to be a dry ſummer, but her can give no great credit to Modern Aſtrologie, becauſe things new are not always true, but if her had her Library, before ſpoken of, her would undertake to reſolve her all her doubts, and ſo her bids her farewel.</p>
